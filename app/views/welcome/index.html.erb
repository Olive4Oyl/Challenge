<p class="title"><strong>Contacts App</strong></p>

<p class="title">The app that allows you to keep track of a person’s/contact’s favorite city. A user can add as many contacts/people and can edit and view an individual contact’s/person’s profile.</p>

<input type="button" value="Contacts App" class="fluid ui green button appButton" />
	

<p>The user can add a new contact by clicking on <strong>Add Contact</strong> or <strong>icon</strong>. This will make a get request to <strong>/people/new</strong> and direct the user to the form used to create a new contact.</p>

<p>The user is able to enter in a contact’s name and favorite city into the appropriate fields. </p>

<p> The user is able to either add this new contact or return to the contact index <strong>/people</strong> by using the back button without adding the new contact. </p>

<p> The <strong>add button</strong> makes a post request to the create action making a new person object with the entered in values/params and the user will be redirected to the contact index page where the newest person can be viewed along with the already existing contacts. </p>

<p> The user is able to edit a contact by clicking on the <strong>edit button.</strong> This makes a get request to <strong>/people/:id/edit</strong>, which redirects the user to the form to edit this specific contact. Once the user has entered in the information, clicking the update button makes a patch request to the route <strong>/people/:id</strong> and updates the attributes and returns to the contact index page. Again the user is given the option to return to the contact index page should the user decide not to update the information. </p>

<p> Finally the user is able to delete a contact by clicking on the <strong>profile button</strong> under the contact’s information on the contact index page. This redirects the user to <strong>/people/:id</strong> where the user can either delete the contact or return to the index page should the user decide not to delete the information. </p>

<p> The <strong>delete button</strong> makes a delete request to <strong>/people/:id</strong> and deletes this person from the database. </p>
